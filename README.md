# Merge-Sort-Algorithm
This C program implements the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. Merge sort is a popular divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm known for its stability and efficiency.

# Files
Merge_sort.c: This file contains the source code implementing the merge sort algorithm.
README.md: This file provides information about the program and its usage.

# Functionality
The Merge_sort.c file contains the following functions:
merge(int arr[], int low, int mid, int high): Merges two subarrays of arr[].
mergesort(int arr[], int low, int high): Recursively sorts the array using the merge sort algorithm.
printarray(int A[], int n): Prints the elements of an array.
In the main() function, an array of integers is defined and sorted using the mergesort() function. The sorted array is then printed using the printarray() function.
